# CEE Server Using Python

## What is Common Event Expression (CEE)?
CEE was developed by MITRE as an extension for Syslog, based on JSON. MITREâ€™s work on CEE was discontinued in 2013. Below is an example of a CEE log message:

```
Dec 20 12:42:20 syslog-relay serveapp[1335]: @cee: {"pri":10,"id":121,"appname":"serveapp","pid":1335,"host":"syslog-relay","time":"2011-12-20T12:38:05.123456-05:00","action":"login","domain":"app","object":"account","status":"success"}
```
## Required Tools

To set up the CEE Server on Redhat/CentOS/Fedora systems, ensure the following tools are installed:

```dnf install python3 python3-tools -y ```

## How to Use the Tool
### Run Manually

1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your preferred location:

```git clone https://github.com/allamiro/cee-server.git```

2. Navigate to the Directory and Run the Script

Change the directory to the cee-server directory and run the script:

```cd cee-server```

```python3 cee_log_server.py```

3. Create a Service for Continuous Execution (Optional)

If you want the script to run as a persistent service:

* Make the ```configure_service.bash``` script executable:

```chmod +x configure_service.bash```

* Execute the script to create the service:

```./configure_service.bash ```

This will create and enable a systemd service for the CEE server.

## Build and Deploy the RPM

### Steps to Build the RPM

1. Install Required Tools

* Install the RPM build tools:

``` sudo dnf install rpm-build rpmlint -y ```

2. Set Up the RPM Build Environment

* Create the directory structure for RPM packaging:

```mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}```

3. Create the Source Tarball

Package the repository into a tarball:

```
cd cee-server
mkdir cee-server-1.0
cp -r ./* cee-server-1.0/
tar --exclude-vcs -czf ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/cee-server-1.0.tar.gz cee-server-1.0
rm -rf cee-server-1.0
```

4. Copy the Spec File

Place the spec file in the appropriate directory:

```cp rpm/SPECS/cee-server.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/```

5. Build the RPM

Run the RPM build process:

```cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
rpmbuild -ba cee-server.spec
```

5. Verify the RPM

Check if the RPM was created successfully:

```ls ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/```

6. Install and Test the RPM

Install the built RPM:

```sudo rpm -ivh ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/cee-server-1.0-1.noarch.rpm```

7. Verify the systemd service is installed and enabled:


```systemctl status cee-server```

8. Start the service if it is not running:

```sudo systemctl start cee-server```
